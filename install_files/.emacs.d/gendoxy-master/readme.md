# gendoxy - An emacs package to generate doxygen documentation from C code
This plugin generates [doxygen](http://doxygen.org ) documentation from C source code.  
It generates doxygen-aware documentation skeleton for the most common C constructs.  
Moreover, function parameters documentation may be partially guessed,  
according to some parameters name pattern.

# Installation
Put file _gendoxy.el_ in a path accessible to emacs (add-to-list 'load-path ...)  
Load it in your init file `(load "gendoxy.el")`

# Configuration
Once the package is loaded, there are four variables that control documentation generation:
* `gendoxy-backslash`: if not _nil_, will use backslash instead of ampersat
* `gendoxy-default-text`: Default string used in generated documentation
* `gendoxy-skip-details`: If not _nil_, will omit details in header and functions
* `gendoxy-details-empty-line`: If not _nil_, will use an empty line instead of
the details tag to add details. Note that this has effect if _gendoxy-skip-details_ is _nil_ ONLY.

# Usage
Put the cursor on the **first** line of a declaration to document  
(not necessarily at the beginning of line), then run the command:  
`M-x gendoxy-tag`  
This will document your declaration and all its sub-items if any.  
If you want to document a declaration, __but not__ its subitems, then run the command:  
`M-x gendoxy-tag-header`

### Groups
To to document a group of items, you can use the command:  
M-x `gendoxy-group`  
To document a group __but not__ the single items, use the command:  
`M-x gendoxy-group-header`  
For groups, since may not be easy to guess start and end of group,  
two explicit commands have been added:  
`gendoxy-group-start` and `gendoxy-group-end`.  
The last command (but the first to use) is:  
`M-x gendoxy-header`  
that generates a header documentation for current file  

# Notes
The gendoxy package doesn't define a new mode, just offers some commands to use.  
For a more productive environment, just [bind](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Key-Bindings.html) your favorite key to  
`gendoxy-tag` and/or `gendoxy-tag-header` commands.  
Additionally, set your details configuration.  
Once your setup is done, open a header file, add the header if missing and go with comments!

gendoxy **do not have** any external dependency, even _cl-lib_ is never called!
